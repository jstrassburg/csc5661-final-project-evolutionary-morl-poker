    "# Evolutionary Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Texas Holdem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define an environment to represent the game of fixed-limit Texas Holdem\n",
    "- Create six agents:\n",
    "  - Four to represent the well-known poker player archetypes: \n",
    "    - Tight-aggressive (TAG) - A normally tight player who gets aggressive with quality hands.\n",
    "    - Loose-aggressive (LAG) - A player who aggressively plays lots of hands regardless of quality.\n",
    "    - Loose-passive (calling station) - A player who plays lots of pots but doesn't aggressively raise quality hands.\n",
    "    - Tight-passive (nit or rock) - A player who plays few hands and only commits chips with quality hands.\n",
    "  - And two to represent our RL trained agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RL trained agents will use an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm and evolutionary reinforcement learning techniques. One will be single objective (single policy to maximize winnings) and the other will be multi-objective (a different policy for each of the playing styles noted above).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will then compare the performance of the single-objective agent to the multi-objective agent."
